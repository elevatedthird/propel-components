# Introduction

This site provides starter SDCs for a drupal site using the Kinetic (>=2.0.0) theme.

## Prerequisites

- Drupal 10.3.0 or higher
- Tailwind 4.0.0 or higher
- SDC module installed (or use Core)

## Getting Started

- Install the [propel module](https://github.com/elevatedthird/propel_drush), which provides a drush command to add an SDC to your theme's `components` directory

## Component Categories

### 00-elements

Contains single elements, such as buttons, links, images, and badges.
Most of these SDCs wrap the utility classes created in your `index.css` file. They primarily exist for showing variants in storybook.
These utility classes are available anywhere in your site, including custom modules and PHP files.

### 01-composites

Contains components that are made up of multiple elements. They aren't
as big as blocks, but are more complex than elements.

### 02-blocks

Contains components that are composed of multiple composites. These are like the blocks in layout builder

### 03-formations

Contains wrappers for layouts. Ex. headers, footers, and sections.

### 04-pages

Contains templates for entire pages
