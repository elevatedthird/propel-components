# Contributing
We welcome new SDCs and improvements to existing SDCs. If you have an idea for a new SDC or want to improve an existing one, keep the following in mind:

1. Is a valid SDC.
2. Contains a `stories.js` file with a default story.
3. Works on light and dark themes.
4. Lists any component dependencies in the `component.yml` file.
5. CSS files must follow `[name].pcss.css` naming
6. JS files must follow `[name].es6.js` naming
7. Do not use embed and blocks.

## Adding dependencies
If your SDC includes another one, add a needs key to the component.yml file.

Ex.
```
...
needs:
  - glide-slide
  - glide-bullets
...
```

## Generating stories

Story files are automatically generated when you create a component.yml file.
The better your component.yml file is, the better your story will be.

```
npm run stories
```

### Ignoring story generation
Add an entry to `EXCLUDED_STORIES` array in `generate-stories.js`

### Forcing story re-generation
Add an entry to `FORCE_RECREATE_STORIES` array in `generate-stories.js`
